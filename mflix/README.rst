================
Welcome to M220J
================

In this course we will be exploring how to use MongoDB in the Java environment.
We will be looking into:

- Different versions and flavors of the MongoDB Java driver
- How to express CRUD operations in Java code
- Using the Aggregation Framework to express analytical queries
- Building an application backend in Java that interacts with MongoDB


Get Started
-----------

For this course we will be setting up an application, ``MFlix``, that will
allow users to list and interact with a movies catalog (any similarity with
other popular video streaming services is pure coincidence!).

In the finished version of the MFlix application, users will be able to:

- Perform movie searches with the following criteria:

  - cast members
  - genre types
  - text matches in title or description
  - country of origin

- Create faceted filters on movie searches
- Create an account and manage their preferences
- Leave comments on their favorite (or least favorite) movies

... among other features, typical of any movie streaming service.

Your job, as new team member of the team that builds MFlix, and soon-to-be
MongoDB Java developer expert, is to implement the backend component, in
specific the Database Access Object (DAO) layer. No worries, your team has
already built all the integration and unit tests, you just need to get them all
to pass!


Project Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MFlix is composed of two main components:

- *Frontend*: All the UI functionality is already implemented for you, which
  includes the built-in React application that you do not need to worry about.

- *Backend*: *Java Spring Boot* project that provides the necessary service to
  the application. The code is managed by a Maven project definition file that
  you will have to load into your Java IDE.

Most of what you will implement is located in the
``src/main/java/mflix/api/daos`` directory, which contains all database
interfacing methods.

The unit tests in ``src/tests/java/mflix/api/daos`` will test these database
access methods directly, without going through the API.

The UI will run these methods as part of the integration tests, and therefore
they are required for the full application to be running.

The API layer is fully implemented, as is the UI. By default the application
will run on port 5000, but if you need it to run on a port other than 5000, you
can edit the ``index.html`` file in the ``build`` directory to modify the value of
**window.host**. You can find ``index.html`` in the
``src/main/resources/build`` directory.

We're using *Spring Boot* for the API. Maven will download this library for you.
More on that below.


Database Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be using *MongoDB Atlas*, MongoDB's official Database as a Service (DBaaS),
so you will not need to manage the database component yourself. However, you will
still need to install MongoDB locally to access the command line tools that interact
with Atlas, to load data into MongoDB and potentially do some exploration of
your database with the shell.

The following set of steps are here to get you setup for this course.


Local Environment Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two main system dependencies in this course:


1. Java 1.8

  * The java version this course is built against is Java 1.8. You can download
    the appropriate version for your operating system by clicking
    `here <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`_

2. Maven

  * We use Maven to manage dependencies for the MFlix project. Click here to
    download `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/install.html>`_


Java Project (MFlix) Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``mflix`` project is supported by a `Maven` POM file that deals with all the
dependencies required, as well as providing the ``test`` and ``run`` commands
to control our project. This means that you can run all the tests and deploy
the ``mflix`` backend from the command line with `Maven`.

However, we recommend you use a Java IDE to follow along with the lessons and
to accomplish the **Tickets** assigned to you in the course.

You can use any IDE that you like, as you do not need to have a specific
product to complete the course.
It would be better if your IDE supports `Maven POM` files, so it can set the
dependencies correctly, otherwise you will need to download and install
manually the different libraries and drivers used by the project.

That said, all the lectures and examples of this course have been produced using
IntelliJ IDEA CE edition. You will find a lesson dedicated to setting up and
exploring this IDE for the course.

Once you downloaded and unzipped the ``mflix-java.zip`` file, you will find the
project folder. The project folder contains the application code, the
``pom.xml`` file that you would import into your IDE, and the dataset
required that you will have to import to Atlas.

.. code-block:: sh

  $ ls
  mflix README.rst
  $ cd mflix
  $ ls
  src pom.xml data


MongoDB Installation
********************

It is recommended to connect *MFlix* with *MongoDB Atlas*, so you do not need to
have a MongoDB server running on your host machine. The lectures and labs in
this course will assume that you are using an *Atlas* cluster instead of a local
instance.

That said, you are still required to have the MongoDB server installed, in order
to be able to use two server tool dependencies:

- ``mongorestore``

  - A utility for importing binary data into MongoDB.

- ``mongo``

  - The shell for exploring data in MongoDB.

To download these command line tools, please visit the
`MongoDB download center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#enterprise>`_
and choose the appropriate platform.


MongoDB Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*MFlix* uses *MongoDB* to persist all its data.

One of the easiest ways to get up and running with MongoDB is to use *MongoDB Atlas*,
a hosted and fully-managed database solution.

If you have taken other MongoDB University courses like M001 or M121, you may
already have an account - feel free to reuse that cluster for this course.

Make sure to use a **free tier cluster** for the application and course.

*Note: Be advised that some of the UI aspects of Atlas may have changed since
the redaction of this README, therefore some of the screenshots in this file may
be different from the actual Atlas UI interface.*


Using an existing MongoDB Atlas Account:
****************************************

If you already have a previous *Atlas* account created, perhaps because you've
taken one of our other MongoDB university courses, you can repurpose it for
M220J.

Log into your *Atlas* account and create a new project named **M220** by clicking
on the *Context* dropdown menu:

.. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_create_project.png

After creating this new project, skip the next section and proceed to the
*Creating an M0 free tier cluster mflix* section.


Creating a new MongoDB Atlas Account:
*************************************

If you do not have an existing *Atlas* account, go ahead and `create an Atlas
Account <https://cloud.mongodb.com/links/registerForAtlas>`_ by filling in the
required fields:

.. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/atlas_registration.png


Creating an M0 free tier cluster **mflix**:
*******************************************

*Note: You will need to do this step even if you are reusing an Atlas account.*

1. After creating a new project, you will be prompted to create the first
   cluster in that project:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_create.png


2. Choose AWS as the cloud provider, in a Region that has the label
   **Free Tier Available**:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_provider.png


3. Select *Cluster Tier* **M0**:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_tier.png


4. Set *Cluster Name* to **mflix** by clicking on the default name
   *Cluster0*, and click *Create Cluster*:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_name.png


5. Once you press *Create Cluster*, you will be redirected to the account
   dashboard. In this dashboard, make sure that the project is named **M220**.
   If not, go to the *Settings* menu item and change the project name
   from the default *Project 0* to **M220**:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_project.png


6. Next, configure the security settings of this cluster, by enabling the *IP
   Whitelist* and *MongoDB Users*:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_ipwhitelisting.png

  Update your IP Whitelist so that your app can talk to the cluster. Click the
  "Security" tab from the "Clusters" page. Then click "IP Whitelist" followed by
  "Add IP Address". Finally, click "Allow Access from Anywhere" and click
  "Confirm".

  *Note that in a production environment, you would control very tightly the list of
  IP addresses that can connect to your cluster.*

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_allowall.png


7. Then create the MongoDB database user required for this course:

  - username: **m220student**
  - password: **m220password**

  You can create new users through *Security* -> *MongoDB Users* -> *Add New User*

  Allow this user the privilege to **Read and write to any database**:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_application_user.png


8. When the user is created, and the cluster is deployed, you can test the setup
   by connecting via the ``mongo`` shell. You can find instructions to connect
   in the *Connect* section of the cluster dashboard:

  .. image:: https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/cluster_connect_application.png

  Go to your cluster *Overview*  -> *Connect* -> *Connect Your Application*.
  Select the option corresponding to MongoDB version3.6+ and copy the
  ``mongo`` connection URI.

  The below example connects to *Atlas* as the user you created before, with
  username **m220student** and password **m220password**. You can run this command
  from your command line:

  .. code-block:: sh

    mongo "mongodb+srv://m220student:m220password@<YOUR_CLUSTER_URI>"

  By connecting to the server from your host machine, you have validated that the
  cluster is configured and reachable from your local workstation.


Importing Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``mongorestore`` command necessary to import the data is located below.
Copy the command and use the *Atlas SRV* string to import the data (including
username and password credentials).

Replace the SRV string below with your own:

.. code-block:: sh

  # navigate to mflix-java directory
  cd mflix-java

  # import data into Atlas
  mongorestore --drop --gzip --uri mongodb+srv://m220student:m220password@<YOUR_CLUSTER_URI> data


Running the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``mflix/src/main/resources`` directory you can find a file called
``application.properties``.

Open this file and enter your *Atlas SRV* connection string as directed in the
comment. This is the information the driver will use to connect. Make sure
**not** to wrap your *Atlas SRV* connection between quotes::

  spring.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://m220student:m220password@<YOUR_CLUSTER_URI>

To run MFlix, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

  cd mflix
  mvn spring-boot:run

And then point your browser to `http://localhost:5000/ <http://localhost:5000/>`_.

It is recommended you use an IDE for this course. Ensure you choose an IDE that
supports importing a Maven project. We recommend IntelliJ Community_ but you
can use the product of your choice.

The first time running the application might take a little longer due to the
initial setup process.

.. _Community: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download


Running the Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the unit tests for this course, you will use ``JUnit``. Each course lab
contains a module of unit tests that you can call individually with a command
like the following:

.. code-block:: sh

  cd mflix
  mvn -Dtest=<TestClass> test

For example to run the ConnectionTest test your shell command will be:

.. code-block:: sh

  cd mflix
  mvn -Dtest=ConnectionTest test

Alternatively, if using an IDE, you should be able to run the Unit Tests
individually by clicking on a green play button next to them. You will see this
demonstrated in the course as we will be using IntelliJ.

Each ticket will contain the command to run that ticket's specific unit tests.
When running the Unit Tests or the Application from the shell, make sure that
you are in the same directory as the ``pom.xml`` file.
